# Horiseon Website

## Description

In this project we refactored code that was given to us.  We went through the HTML and replaced all the \<div>'s with the correct semantic tags.  We then went through and refactored the CSS file included.  We consolidated the css and made sure it was using proper structure and naming.

While refactoring the code, I learned how some semantic HTML elements are simple containers like \<div>, making them easy replacements for \<div> and help improve the readability and accessibility of the website. Other HTML elements like \<details> add additional functionality, making it not an ideal candidate for replacing basic containers.
